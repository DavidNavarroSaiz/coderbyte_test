# Coderbyte Test Solutions
This repository contains solutions to three Coderbyte tests, aiming to foster understanding, study, and improvement of programming skills. The primary objective is not to provide ready-made answers for exams, but rather to aid in comprehension and skill enhancement.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:

Enhance Programming Skills: Explore various problem-solving approaches and techniques, enabling the enhancement of programming skills.

Foster Understanding: Encourage individuals to delve into the intricacies of the provided solutions, promoting a deeper understanding of algorithms and code optimization.

Support Learning: Serve as a valuable learning resource for those seeking to improve their coding abilities and tackle coding challenges.

## Tests and Descriptions
### 1. Gas Station
Problem Statement:

You are given an array strArr containing information about gas stations in a circular route. Each element is in the format g:c, where g is the amount of gas in gallons at that gas station, and c is the amount of gallons of gas needed to get to the following gas station.

For example: ["4","3:1","2:2","1:2","0:1"]

Your task is to return the index of the starting gas station that allows you to travel around the whole route once. If not possible, return the string "impossible."

### 2. Age Prediction
Problem Statement:

In a Python dataset, you need to create a model to predict the age of abalones using a provided CSV dataset.

Convert the feature dataset into a numpy array.
Create a sequential model with 2 layers: a dense layer with 64 units and a second layer with 1 unit.
Compile the model with mean squared error loss and the optimizer set to Adam.
Fit the dataset on abalone_features for 10 epochs with verbosity set to 0.
Print both the training history and the model summary.
### 3. Stock Prediction
Problem Statement:

You need to create a Sequential model with 5 layers for stock prediction.

Use 2 LSTM layers, and after each, use a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2.
The first LSTM layer should have input_shape as a parameter along with units set to 4.
The final layer should be a Dense layer with units set to 1.
Compile the model with mean squared error loss and the optimizer set to Adam.
Fit the training dataset with epochs=5, batch_size=16, and verbosity set to 0.
Run the predict function on the x_test dataset and print the last column of the array along with the model summary.
